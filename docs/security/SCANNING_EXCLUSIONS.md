# Security Scanning Exclusions

This document explains which directories and files are excluded from security scanning and why.

## Excluded Directories

### `electron/renderer/` (entire directory)
**Reason**: This directory contains Vite build output, not source code. It includes:
- Compiled JavaScript bundles
- Processed CSS files
- Asset files (images, icons, fonts)
- Generated HTML files

**Excluded from**:
- CodeQL (via `.codeqlignore`)
- Semgrep (via `.semgrepignore` and `--exclude` flags in CI)

### `electron/renderer/assets/` (explicit exclusion)
**Reason**: Build artifacts, images, CSS, and JS bundles generated by Vite. These are not source code and should not be security scanned.

**Excluded from**:
- CodeQL (via `.codeqlignore`)
- Semgrep (via `.semgrepignore` and `--exclude` flags in CI)

## Configuration Files

- **`.codeqlignore`**: Excludes paths from CodeQL analysis
- **`.semgrepignore`**: Excludes paths from Semgrep analysis
- **CI Workflows**: Explicit `--exclude=electron/renderer/**` flags in Semgrep commands

## Dismissing Existing Alerts

If you have existing alerts from these excluded paths:

1. **Manual Dismissal** (Recommended):
   - Go to: https://github.com/ShiftlineTools/gen-image-factory/security/code-scanning
   - Dismiss each alert with reason: "False positive - excluded build artifacts"
   - Add note: "Path excluded from scanning per `.codeqlignore`/`.semgrepignore`"

2. **Auto-Resolution**:
   - Alerts will auto-resolve after the next successful scan run that excludes these paths
   - No new findings = alerts marked as resolved
