## Story 

**As a** user,
**I want** a dedicated Job Management experience with a full single-job view and batch actions,
**so that** I can preview recent runs on the Dashboard, deep-dive into one job, and perform efficient batch operations on multiple jobs in a focused page.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard Job History = Overview Only
   - The Dashboard `JobHistory` shows a recent overview (e.g., last 20 runs) with status, counts, duration.
   - Each job row is clickable to open a full Single Job View (modal or dedicated route).
   - No batch actions on the Dashboard; only quick actions per job (View, Export, Delete, Rerun).

2. Single Job View (Full Detail)
   - Opens from Dashboard history or Job Management page.
   - Displays full job metadata (timestamps, status, counts, error if any) and generated images filtered to this job.
   - Provides actions: Rename Job Run (label), Export to Excel, Rerun, Delete.
   - Rename persists to DB and reflects across Dashboard and Job Management.

3. Dedicated Job Management Page
   - Accessible from the Dashboard header menu item “Job Management”.
   - Displays a full, paginated table of `JobExecutions` with multi-select.
   - Provides batch actions: Delete selected, Export selected (per-job Excel), Rerun selected (queued sequentially respecting single-job constraint).
   - Sorting (date/status/duration) and filtering (status, configuration) with search.
   - Selection persists across pagination; select-all-in-filtered-view supported.

4. Rename and Data Hygiene
   - Users can rename a job run from Single Job View and Job Management table inline.
   - Single-job delete cascades to images atomically with confirmation.
   - Batch delete shows count and requires confirmation; errors are summarized.

5. UX, Accessibility, and Performance
   - Tailwind styles; WCAG 2.1 AA; keyboard selection and batch-action execution.
   - Table virtualized/paginated beyond 200 rows to stay responsive.
   - All destructive actions use confirmations; long operations show progress.

6. IPC & Adapter Additions
   - Add: `job-execution:rename` (id, label), `job-execution:bulk-delete` (ids), `job-execution:bulk-export` (ids), `job-execution:bulk-rerun` (ids → queued sequentially).
   - Existing: `getJobHistory`, `getJobResults`, `deleteJobExecution`, `exportJobToExcel` remain for per-job actions.
   - All inputs validated; errors translated via adapter utilities.

7. Retry Execution (Post-processing only; Story 1.7 alignment)
   - Retry runs only post-processing steps on existing files; it never re-generates images.
   - Source images are taken from Settings `tempDirectory` (fallback `./picture/generated`) using each image's `finalImagePath`.
   - Original settings mode applies the original execution's post-processing subset (single-execution only).
   - Modified settings mode applies sanitized batch post-processing; optionally include metadata regeneration via a checkbox/flag.
   - Respect single-job constraint: start immediately if idle; otherwise queue in-memory and run when idle.
   - Emit progress via existing channels with a `context: 'retry'` marker; update `qcStatus` as processing advances.

8. Testing
   - Unit: rename, bulk delete/export/rerun adapter methods; selection logic utilities.
   - Integration: DB writes/reads for label, bulk operations; sequential rerun queueing.
   - E2E: Dashboard overview click-through to Single Job View; Job Management batch delete/export/rerun; inline rename; accessibility.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- Database & Models
  - [x] Add `label TEXT NULL` to `job_executions` (schema migration) for human-friendly job run names.
  - [x] Ensure indices exist on `started_at`, `status`, and `configuration_id`; keep transactional consistency for deletes.

- Backend Adapter & IPC
  - [x] Implement IPC handlers: `job-execution:rename`, `job-execution:bulk-delete`, `job-execution:bulk-export`, `job-execution:bulk-rerun`.
  - [x] Preload exposure on `window.electronAPI` for new endpoints; add to whitelist.
  - [x] Validate and clamp inputs; translate errors consistently.

- Renderer UI — Dashboard Overview
  - [x] Keep Dashboard `JobHistory` as overview-only; each row opens Single Job View.
  - [x] Remove/avoid batch selection from Dashboard.
  - [x] Ensure quick actions (View, Export, Delete, Rerun) remain.

- Single Job View
  - [x] Build Single Job View (modal or dedicated page) with details, images, rename, export, rerun, delete.
  - [x] Deep-link from Dashboard overview and Job Management table.

- Job Management Page
  - [x] Create `Jobs/JobManagementPanel.tsx` with table, filters, search, pagination, multi-select.
  - [x] Implement batch actions: delete (with confirmation), export (per-job Excel), rerun (queued sequentially).
  - [x] Inline rename for label with optimistic update and rollback on failure.
  - [x] Show queue indicator when reruns are scheduled; enforce single-job constraint.

- Retry Executor (Post-processing only; no generation)
  - Backend
    - [x] Extend `retryFailedImagesBatch(imageIds, useOriginalSettings, modifiedSettings)` to trigger a post-processing executor immediately (when idle) or queue in-memory if a job is running.
    - [x] Resolve source files from Settings `tempDirectory` (fallback `./picture/generated`) via each image's `finalImagePath`.
    - [x] Original settings: resolve post-processing subset from the originating execution; disallow cross-execution batches.
    - [x] Modified settings: apply sanitized batch settings; add optional `includeMetadata` flag to regenerate metadata.
    - [x] Do not invoke prompt/image generation during Retry; only post-processing (+ optional metadata).
    - [x] Emit progress via existing job channels with `context: 'retry'`; translate errors via `errorTranslation`.
    - [x] Update `qcStatus` transitions per image (retry_pending → processing → approved/failed); persist outcomes.
  - IPC / Preload
    - [x] Extend `failed-image:retry-batch` payload to accept `{ includeMetadata?: boolean }` (or add a companion channel); whitelist in `electron/preload.js`.
  - UI (Failed Images Review / Modal)
    - [x] Update `ProcessingSettingsModal` to include a "Also regenerate metadata" checkbox.
    - [x] Disable Retry actions when another job is running; show queued indicator when applicable.
    - [x] After starting Retry, surface progress and final outcomes; refresh failed images list.
  - Preconditions & Guards
    - [x] Retry available only after at least one full job completed; validate selected images belong to completed execution(s).
    - [x] Enforce original-settings path only for single-execution selections; otherwise require modified settings.
  - Tests
    - [x] Unit: settings resolution (original vs modified), `includeMetadata` handling, queue behavior, qcStatus transitions.
    - [x] Integration: post-processing against file paths (mocked IO), progress events, DB updates.
    - [x] E2E: Failed Images Review with metadata checkbox; progress to completion and UI refresh.

- Accessibility & Performance
  - [x] ARIA roles/labels for tables, selection, and batch actions; full keyboard flows.
  - [x] Virtualization/pagination for large result sets; debounce filters/search.

- Testing
  - [x] Unit: selection logic, rename, bulk ops; IPC adapters; DB migration tests.
  - [x] Integration: bulk operations, sequential rerun, transactional deletes.
  - [ ] E2E: new `tests/e2e/workflows/job-management.e2e.test.ts` for page; `single-job-view.e2e.test.ts` for deep link and actions.

## Dev Notes

- Architecture Alignment
  - Dashboard remains the operational console; Job History there is a compact overview.
  - Job Management becomes a dedicated page under `src/renderer/components/Jobs/` with its own tests.
  - Single Job View is implemented as a dedicated page (NOT modal) for better image handling with thousands of images.
  - Deep linking from Dashboard and Job Management to Single Job View.

- Security
  - API keys continue to use native OS keychain via `keytar`; DB falls back to plain text only in development (to be replaced by encryption in Story 1.11).
  - Mask sensitive values in logs; validate and sanitize user inputs for deletes/clears.

- Transactions & Backup
  - Use `src/database/transactionManager.js` for multi-table operations.
  - Consider invoking `backupManager` before bulk deletions (optional guard in non-dev environments).

- Performance Considerations
  - Prefer computed stats on read for large datasets unless measurements justify persisted aggregates.
  - Debounce sort/filter inputs; avoid expensive re-renders by memoizing derived lists.
  - Implement virtualization for tables with 1000+ rows.
  - Use lazy loading for job details and images.
