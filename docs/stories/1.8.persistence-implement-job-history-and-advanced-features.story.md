# Story 1.8: Persistence - Implement Job History and Advanced Features

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive job management system with persistence, advanced filtering, batch operations, and a dedicated Single Job View for detailed job inspection and management.

## Requirements

### Job Management — Dedicated Page, Single Job View, and Batch Operations
- [x] Add `label` to `job_executions` table
- [x] Ensure indices for performance
- [x] Implement IPC handlers for job management
- [x] Expose preload for job management
- [x] Validate inputs and handle errors
- [x] Create `JobManagementPanel` component
- [x] Implement batch actions (rerun, export, delete)
- [x] Implement inline rename functionality
- [x] Add queue indicator for batch operations
- [x] Build `SingleJobView` component
- [x] Implement deep-linking to Single Job View

### Retry Execution
- [x] Implement post-processing only retry
- [x] Add metadata regeneration support
- [x] Create RetryExecutor service
- [x] Implement queue management
- [x] Add progress tracking
- [x] Integrate with existing image processing

### Accessibility & Performance
- [x] ARIA roles/labels for tables, selection, and batch actions
- [x] Full keyboard navigation flows
- [x] Virtualization/pagination for large result sets
- [x] Debounced filters/search
- [x] Memoized components and computed values
- [x] Performance optimizations for large datasets

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests: selection logic, rename, bulk ops
- [x] Unit tests: IPC adapters
- [x] Unit tests: DB migration tests
- [x] Unit tests: Job management components (143/143 tests passing)
- [x] Unit tests: Accessibility and performance features
- [x] Integration tests: bulk operations, sequential rerun, transactional deletes
- [ ] E2E tests: new `tests/e2e/workflows/job-management.e2e.test.ts` for page
- [ ] E2E tests: `single-job-view.e2e.test.ts` for deep link and actions
