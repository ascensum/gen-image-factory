- FileSelector minor accessibility issues (low priority)
- File picker functionality pending Electron backend implementation
- **File Selection UI Enhancement Required** - SettingsPanel FilePathsSection needs to use FileSelector components instead of regular HTML inputs
- **Backend Integration Ready** - Story 1.2 has completed all backend file selection enhancements, UI implementation pending

## Logical Interface Improvements (Latest Update)
### **🎯 Major Interface Redesign**
- **Master Toggle System**: Implemented proper feature dependencies
  - "Image Convert" serves as master switch for all image conversion features
  - "Remove Background" controls Remove.bg size visibility
  - "Image Enhancement" controls sharpening/saturation controls visibility

### **🔧 Conditional Visibility Logic**
- **Remove.bg Size**: Only appears when "Remove Background" is enabled
- **Convert Format**: Only appears when "Image Convert" is enabled  
- **Image Enhancement**: **Independent feature** - always visible (no longer depends on Image Convert)
- **Sharpening/Saturation**: Only appear when "Image Enhancement" is enabled
- **Trim Transparent Background**: Only appears when "Remove Background" is enabled (grouped under Remove Background section)
- **JPG Background Colour**: Only appears when Remove Background + Image Convert + JPG format are enabled
- **Quality Settings**: Only appear when "Image Convert" is enabled

### **🎨 UI/UX Enhancements**
- **Centered Navigation**: Menu items are now centered horizontally in the left sidebar
- **Centered Action Buttons**: Save and Reset buttons are centered at the bottom
- **Logical Grouping**: Related settings are grouped together (Midjourney, OpenAI, Generation settings)
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Settings appear in logical order with proper dependencies
- **Visual Grouping**: Trim Transparent Background is now grouped under Remove Background section
- **Quality Settings Positioning**: JPG/PNG Quality settings moved to appear right after Convert Format for clearer visual separation
- **JPG Background Color Positioning**: JPG Background Color moved to appear right after PNG Quality for better visual grouping

### **🔧 New Features Added**
- **Image Enhancement Toggle**: **Independent feature** - no longer depends on Image Convert
- **Sharpening Control**: Range slider (0-10) for sharpening intensity
- **Saturation Control**: Range slider (0-2) for saturation level
- **Enhanced JPG Background**: Dropdown with White/Black/Transparent options
- **Simplified Format Selection**: Only PNG and JPG formats supported (removed WebP and AVIF)

### **🔧 Backend Implementation for Image Enhancement**
- **Updated `src/producePictureModule.js`**:
  - Added `imageEnhancement`, `sharpening`, and `saturation` parameters to `processImage()` function
  - Replaced hardcoded sharpening (`sigma: 5`) and saturation (`1.4`) with configurable values
  - Implemented conditional enhancement: only applies when `imageConvert && imageEnhancement` is true
  - Added logging for sharpening intensity and saturation level application
  - Sharpening only applied when `sharpening > 0`
  - Saturation only applied when `saturation !== 1`

- **Updated `src/index.js`**:
  - Added `imageEnhancement` command-line argument (boolean)
  - Added `sharpening` command-line argument (number, default: 5)
  - Added `saturation` command-line argument (number, default: 1.4)
  - Added environment variable support: `IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT`, `SHARPENING`, `SATURATION`
  - Integrated new parameters into centralized configuration object

## Story

- Database models in `src/database/`
- Settings will be accessible via main application navigation
- Native OS integration for file dialogs and credential storage

### Approved Co-located Test Structure
**Dev Agent Implementation**: The dev agent implemented a co-located test structure for component tests, which has been approved and should be used as the standard pattern for future component development.

**Benefits of Co-located Tests**:
- **Maintainability**: Tests are located next to their components, making them easier to find and update
- **Developer Experience**: When modifying a component, the test file is immediately visible
- **Industry Standard**: Follows React community best practices and modern testing patterns
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers don't need to navigate between separate test directories

**Implementation Pattern**:
```
src/renderer/components/[ComponentName]/
├── ComponentName.tsx
├── ComponentName.module.css (if applicable)
└── __tests__/
    ├── ComponentName.test.tsx
    └── ComponentName.integration.test.tsx (if needed)
```

**Current Settings Component Test Structure**:
- All 8 Settings components have co-located tests in `src/renderer/components/Settings/__tests__/`
- Test files follow the naming convention: `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- Tests use Vitest and React Testing Library as specified in architecture
- Coverage includes unit tests, integration tests, and accessibility tests

**Future Component Development**: All new components should follow this co-located test pattern for consistency and maintainability.
