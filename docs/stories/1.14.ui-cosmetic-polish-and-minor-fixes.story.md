# Story 1.14: UI Cosmetic Polish & Minor Fixes (Ongoing Small PR Lane)

## Status
Ready to Implement

## Story
As a product owner and end user,
I want incremental cosmetic improvements delivered continuously via small PRs,
so that the UI feels consistent, tidy, and professional without risk to functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Scope limited to non‑functional visual polish unless explicitly approved (no behavior changes).
2. Approved focus areas include:
   - Alignment, spacing, typography, icon sizes, and color consistency
   - Status badge styles and label capitalization
   - Hover/focus states and interactive affordances
   - Dark/light mode consistency (where applicable)
   - Microcopy clarity (grammar, punctuation), without changing meaning
3. No layout regressions (visual diff or manual spot check across dashboard, job management, settings, and results views).
4. PRs are small, well‑scoped, and easy to review (< ~150 lines changed where possible).
5. Each PR updates a brief change log entry (what changed, why, before/after screenshot when helpful).
6. Visual changes pass existing unit/E2E tests and eslint/style checks.

## Process
- Intake: PO will provide an ongoing list of small tweaks; maintain a running checklist in this story.
- Execution: Submit small PRs continuously; each PR references this story with a checklist item.
- Validation: Reviewer confirms no behavior changes and no layout regressions; merge behind regular safeguards.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Establish a living checklist (in this story) for specific tweaks supplied by the PO.
- [ ] Unify badge styles (size, border radius, colors) across components.
- [ ] Normalize heading and section spacing using Tailwind utilities.
- [ ] Align form field widths and labels across settings panels.
- [ ] Ensure consistent button variants (primary/secondary/ghost) and disabled states.
- [ ] Review dark mode tokens for contrast and consistency (if enabled).
- [ ] Add visual test notes (manual before/after screenshots or lightweight visual diff locally).
- [ ] Update a short change log with each merged tweak.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] A first batch of small UI polish PRs merged with no regressions.
- [ ] Checklist in this story seeded and trackable for next iterations.
- [ ] Visual consistency improved across at least 3 major surfaces (dashboard, job management, settings, results).
- [ ] Tests and lints remain green.

## Risks
- Small PRs may accumulate unnoticed style drift; keep a brief design token reference and component examples.
- Avoid functional changes unless explicitly approved to reduce regression risk.
