# Story 1.14: UI Cosmetic Polish & Minor Fixes (Ongoing Small PR Lane)

## Status
Ready to Implement

## Story
As a product owner and end user,
I want incremental cosmetic improvements delivered continuously via small commits,
so that the UI feels consistent, tidy, and professional without risk to functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Scope limited to non‑functional visual polish unless explicitly approved (no behavior changes).
2. Approved focus areas include:
   - Alignment, spacing, typography, icon sizes, and color consistency
   - Status badge styles and label capitalization
   - Hover/focus states and interactive affordances
   - Microcopy clarity (grammar, punctuation), without changing meaning
3. No layout regressions (visual diff or manual spot check across dashboard, job management, settings, and results views).
4. Commits are small, well‑scoped, and easy to review (< ~150 lines changed where possible).
5. Each commit updates a brief change log entry (what changed, why, before/after screenshot when helpful).
6. Visual changes pass existing unit/E2E tests and eslint/style checks.

## Process
- Intake: PO will provide an ongoing list of small tweaks; maintain a running checklist in this story.
- Execution: Submit small commits continuously; each commit references this story with a checklist item.
- Validation: Reviewer confirms no behavior changes and no layout regressions; merge behind regular safeguards.

### Implementation Notes

#### Modal Delete Navigation Fix (2025-11-07)

**Issue:** Single Image Modals (Image Gallery & Failed Images Review) closed immediately after clicking Delete button instead of staying open and navigating to next image.

**Root Causes:**
1. Type mismatch - Image IDs compared as number vs string, causing `findIndex` to return -1
2. Parent component polling/refresh interfered with modal state
3. Immediate refresh triggered modal closure

**Solution Applied to Both Modals:**
- Type-safe ID comparisons using `String()` conversion
- Synchronous modal state updates via `flushSync()` from `react-dom`
- Separate delete flow bypassing parent handler (direct API call)
- Modal lock mechanism (`deletingImageRef`, `modalLockedRef`) to prevent premature closure
- Image caching (`modalImageCache`) for smooth transitions
- Deferred background refresh (100ms + 50ms) to update grid without closing modal

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/ImageGallery.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/FailedImagesReviewPanel.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/FailedImageReviewModal.tsx` (added optional `onDelete` prop)

#### Failed Images Review Modal Architecture Refactor (2025-11-08)

**Issue:** After implementing delete navigation, the Failed Images Review modal exhibited a visual flash and zoom reset when navigating between images. This occurred despite the zoom/pan state tracking working correctly.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Modal Unmount/Remount Cycle:** The `FailedImagesReviewPanel` component was remounting whenever `loadAllImageStatuses()` was called after each action
2. **Parent Re-renders:** When the panel remounted, all child components (including the modal) unmounted and remounted, losing internal state (zoom, pan, etc.)
3. **Infinite Loop on Delete:** Deleted images remained in `filteredAndSortedImages` array, causing the modal to navigate to already-deleted images repeatedly
4. **React Internal Warnings:** Initial attempts using `React.memo` with Portal caused React reconciliation conflicts

**Why This Refactor Was Necessary:**
- **User Experience:** The flash/zoom reset was jarring and broke the continuous review workflow
- **Architectural Flaw:** Modal component lifecycle was tightly coupled to parent data refresh cycles
- **Workflow Efficiency:** Users needed to review/approve/retry multiple images in sequence without modal closure or state loss

**Solution: React Portal + Optimistic Updates**

Created `FailedImageModalContainer` component with the following architecture:

1. **React Portal Isolation:**
   ```typescript
   ReactDOM.createPortal(<FailedImageReviewModal />, document.body)
   ```
   - Renders modal directly to `document.body`, outside parent component tree
   - Modal survives parent unmount/remount cycles completely
   - State (zoom, pan, scroll position) persists across navigation

2. **Optimistic UI Updates:**
   ```typescript
   const [deletedImageIds, setDeletedImageIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
   
   // Filter deleted IDs immediately
   filteredAndSortedImages.filter(img => !deletedImageIds.has(String(img.id)))
   ```
   - Deleted/approved images removed from list instantly
   - Prevents navigation to stale images
   - Grid refreshes only when modal closes

3. **Unified Action Handlers:**
   - All three actions (Delete, Approve, Add to Retry) now share the same navigation logic:
     - Compute next image before action
     - Execute action (delete/approve/add to retry)
     - Navigate to next (or previous if last)
     - Close modal only when no images remain
   
4. **Container Pattern Benefits:**
   - Encapsulates modal state management
   - Decouples modal lifecycle from parent data fetching
   - Provides stable API surface with callback props
   - Lock mechanism prevents race conditions during actions

**Technical Implementation:**

**New Component:** `FailedImageModalContainer.tsx`
- Wraps `FailedImageReviewModal` with Portal
- Manages state: `modalImageCache`, `deletingImageRef`, `modalLockedRef`
- Provides handlers: `handleApprove`, `handleRetry`, `handleDelete`
- Passes navigation callbacks to modal

**Modified:** `FailedImagesReviewPanel.tsx`
- Added `deletedImageIds` state for optimistic updates
- Removed immediate `loadAllImageStatuses()` calls during actions
- Deferred refresh to modal close: `onClose={() => { setDeletedImageIds(new Set()); loadAllImageStatuses(); }}`
- Added dedicated handlers for each action type

**Modified:** `FailedImageReviewModal.tsx`
- Added optional props: `onApprove`, `onRetry` (in addition to existing `onDelete`)
- Button handlers now use dedicated callbacks instead of generic `onAction`
- Maintains zoom/pan state tracking (unchanged)

**Result:**
- ✅ No flash or zoom reset during navigation
- ✅ Smooth transitions between images
- ✅ Deleted images disappear immediately
- ✅ All actions (Delete/Approve/Retry) auto-navigate
- ✅ Modal stays open for continuous workflow
- ✅ Grid updates when modal closes
- ✅ No React warnings or performance issues

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/FailedImageModalContainer.tsx` (new file)
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/FailedImagesReviewPanel.tsx` (major refactor)
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/FailedImageReviewModal.tsx` (prop additions)
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/index.ts` (export added)

#### Bulk Action Button Alignment Fix (2025-11-09)

**Issue:** The three bulk action buttons (Approve Selected, Retry Selected, Delete Selected) in the Failed Images Review gallery had inconsistent heights. The "Retry Selected" button appeared slightly taller when active/enabled.

**Solution:**
- Added `flex items-center` to all three buttons for consistent vertical centering
- Changed vertical padding from `py-1` to `py-2` for better visual balance
- Ensures uniform height regardless of button state (enabled/disabled/processing with spinner)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/FailedImagesReviewPanel.tsx`

---

#### Duplicate Button & Tab Bleeding Fix (2025-11-09)

**Issue:** When images were selected in the Image Gallery tab, a "Delete Selected" button would appear overlaid on the "Job Progress" header text when switching to the Overview tab.

**Root Cause:** A duplicate "Delete Selected" button was accidentally placed inside the Overview tab's "Job Progress" header section (likely from copy-paste during earlier refactoring).

**Solution:**
- Removed the duplicate button from Overview tab's Job Progress header
- Button now only exists in Image Gallery tab where it belongs

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/DashboardPanel.tsx`

---

#### Image Gallery Button Height Consistency (2025-11-09)

**Issue:** The "Export ZIP" and "Delete Selected" buttons in the Image Gallery tab filters/controls area had smaller height compared to modal action buttons, creating visual inconsistency.

**Solution:**
- Updated padding: `px-3 py-1` → `px-4 py-2` (matches modal buttons at 36px height)
- Increased icon size: `w-3 h-3` → `w-4 h-4` (16px, matches modal icons)
- Improved spacing: `space-x-1` → `gap-2` for consistent button content layout

**Result:**
All action buttons across dashboard now share consistent sizing:
- Export ZIP button (Image Gallery)
- Delete Selected button (Image Gallery)
- Delete button (Single Image View modal)
- Action buttons (Failed Images Review modal)
- Bulk action buttons (Failed Images Review panel)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/DashboardPanel.tsx`

#### Processing Settings Modal Text Clarity (2025-11-09)

**Issue:** The Processing Settings Modal (Failed Images Review → Retry Selected) used "QC" abbreviation which wasn't immediately clear to users. The important note also needed clarification about what happens during retry operations.

**Changes Made:**
1. **Important Note:** Changed "Images will NOT be regenerated - only QC, metadata, and processing" to "Images will NOT be regenerated and Quality Controlled - only metadata or/and processing will be updated"
2. **Original Settings Helper:** Changed "(QC, metadata, processing)" to "(Metadata, processing)"
3. **Modified Settings Helper:** Changed "(QC, metadata, processing)" to "(Metadata, processing)"

**Rationale:**
- Spell out "Quality Controlled" instead of "QC" for clarity
- Emphasize that retry operations skip both AI generation AND quality control phases
- Make it explicit that only metadata regeneration and post-processing are available

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/ProcessingSettingsModal.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/__tests__/ProcessingSettingsModal.test.tsx` (test updated)

#### Failed Image Review Modal Feature Parity (2025-11-09)

**Issue:** The Failed Image Review Single Image modal was missing two useful features that exist in the main Dashboard Image Gallery modal: the "Image Control Info" help button and the "File Path" field in the Details tab.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Image Control Info Button:**
   - Added button in modal header between Delete button and navigation arrows
   - Matches main dashboard modal styling (`px-2 py-1 text-xs`)
   - Toggles help popup showing viewer controls:
     - Pan: Click and drag on the image
     - Zoom: Ctrl (Windows/Linux) or ⌘ Cmd (macOS) + mouse wheel
     - Fit: Double‑click image
     - Toolbar (bottom‑right): Zoom out (−), Zoom in (+), Reset, Fit to screen
   - Popup includes close button and proper z-indexing

2. **File Path Field:**
   - Added to Details tab after Date field in Generation Details section
   - Displays `finalImagePath` or `tempImagePath` (fallback to "—")
   - Uses monospace font with `break-all` for long paths

**Result:**
Both modals now have feature parity for user information and controls.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/FailedImageReviewModal.tsx`

#### Image Gallery Filter Controls Responsive Layout (2025-11-10)

**Issue:** On the main Dashboard Image Gallery tab, the filter and search header controls (View, Job, date pickers, Today/Week/Month buttons, Search, Sort, Select All, Clear, Export ZIP, Delete Selected) were all arranged in a single row. In narrow viewports (minimized window), some elements would overflow out of the viewport and become inaccessible.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Filter Controls Container:**
   - Changed from `flex items-center space-x-4` to `flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4`
   - Allows View, Job, Date Range, Search, and Sort controls to wrap to next row when needed

2. **Action Buttons Container:**
   - Changed from `flex items-center space-x-2` to `flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2`
   - Allows Select All, Clear, Export ZIP, and Delete Selected to wrap when needed

3. **Utility Class Updates:**
   - Replaced `space-x-*` with `gap-*` for proper spacing that respects wrapping
   - Maintained `space-x-2` for atomic control groups (e.g., label + input) that shouldn't wrap internally

**Result:**
The filter controls now wrap to multiple rows on narrow viewports, ensuring all controls remain accessible and usable even when the dashboard window is minimized.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/DashboardPanel.tsx`
