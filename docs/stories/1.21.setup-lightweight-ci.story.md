# Story 1.21: Setup Lightweight CI

**Role:** DevOps Engineer
**Feature:** Clean Room Validation & CI
**Story Type:** Chore / Infrastructure

## Description

Implement a lightweight "Clean Room Validation" workflow in GitHub Actions to ensure that the codebase builds and tests pass on a clean, standard environment. This eliminates "works on my machine" issues and provides a baseline quality gate for the solo developer workflow (direct-to-main).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **CI Workflow Exists:** A `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file is created.
2.  **Trigger:** Workflow runs on `push` to `main`.
3.  **Clean Build:** The workflow successfully installs dependencies (`npm ci`) and builds the application (`npm run build`) on an Ubuntu runner.
4.  **Test Execution:** The workflow runs the full test suite (`npm test`) and passes.
5.  **Failure Notification:** If the build or tests fail, the workflow outcome is "Failure" (visible in GitHub UI).
6.  **Performance:** The workflow uses caching (for `node_modules`) to complete in a reasonable time (< 5-10 mins).

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- [ ] Define jobs for:
    - Checkout code.
    - Setup Node.js (v20 or matching project version).
    - Cache `node_modules`.
    - Install dependencies (`npm ci`).
    - Run Build (`npm run build`).
    - Run Tests (`npm test`).
- [ ] Verify workflow runs successfully on a test push.
- [ ] Add build status badge to `README.md` (optional but recommended).

## Dependencies

- None (Independent infrastructure task).
