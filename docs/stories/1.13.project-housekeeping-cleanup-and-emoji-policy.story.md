# Story 1.13: Project Housekeeping — Cleanup Junk, Logs, and Emoji Policy

## Status
In Progress

## Story
As a maintainer,
I want the repository and runtime artifacts to be clean and professional,
so that developers and users don’t encounter junk files, noisy logs, or emojis in code/logs (emojis are allowed only in documentation).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Junk/trash artifacts are removed from the repo; future junk is prevented by updated `.gitignore` and scripts.
   - Examples of junk: temporary exports, ad‑hoc bundles/archives, transient test reports, local runtime logs, scratch CSV/XLSX output.
   - Keep intentional assets (icons, docs, architecture specs) and historical DB backups that are intentionally tracked.
2. Emoji usage policy is enforced:
   - Emojis allowed only in `.md` files.
   - No emojis in source code (`.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`), logs, or commit messages.
   - Pre‑commit hook updated to fail on emoji usage in non‑MD files.
3. Logging output is professional and parseable:
   - Remove decorative glyphs/emojis from logs and console.
   - Adopt consistent levels (debug/info/warn/error) and redact sensitive data.
4. Repository hygiene tooling exists:
   - Script to scan for junk files and emoji violations with a clear report and non‑zero exit on violations.
   - NPM scripts documented (e.g., `npm run repo:scan`, `npm run repo:clean`).
5. Documentation updated:
   - Contributing section briefly states emoji/logging policy.
   - PR checklist includes “no emojis in code/logs/commits”.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- Junk control
  - [x] Audit and remove existing junk artifacts from the repo.
  - [x] Expand `.gitignore` for transient outputs (exports, test reports, local logs, temp bundles).
  - [x] Add `scripts/repo-scan.js` and `scripts/repo-clean.js` (or equivalent) with allowlist/denylist.

- Emoji policy & hooks
  - [x] Update `scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh` to reject emojis in non‑MD files and commit messages.
  - [x] Add lightweight CI job (or npm script) to run the emoji/junk scans.

- Logging cleanup
  - [x] Remove emojis/decorative glyphs from any logger/console usage.
  - [x] Standardize logger usage and redact sensitive values.

- Documentation
  - [x] Update docs to include emoji/logging policy and repo hygiene steps.
  - [x] Add PR checklist item referencing policy (N/A for solo dev; documented guardrails instead).

## Technical Notes
- Emoji detection can use a Unicode character class check; prefer a small Node script to avoid false positives in MD files.
- Keep a strict allowlist for tracked binary artifacts (icons, packaged docs) and denylist common junk patterns (e.g., `*.zip` in outputs, local `playwright-report/`).

## Definition of Done
- [x] Repo contains no junk artifacts; `.gitignore` blocks common future junk.
- [x] No emojis in code/logs/commit messages; MD files remain allowed.
- [x] Pre‑commit and npm scripts enforce the policy locally; CI (optional) mirrors checks.
- [x] Logging output is clean, levelled, and free of decorative glyphs/emojis.
- [x] Docs updated (policy + PR checklist or solo-dev guardrails noted).

## Risks
- Over‑aggressive cleaning could remove useful artifacts; use an allowlist for critical directories/files.
- Emoji detection must exclude `.md` to prevent false failures.
