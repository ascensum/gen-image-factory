  - **Debug Mode Integration**: Automatic log level selection based on user settings
  - **Ring Buffer Logic**: Proper log accumulation without memory leaks
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Database paths work on all operating systems
  - **Test Optimization**: Better vitest execution for regression prevention

### **üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
**These three issues were CONNECTED and stemmed from a fundamental architectural problem in the rerun system:**
- **Configuration editing** works (UI level) ‚úÖ
- **Configuration saving** works (database level) ‚úÖ
- **Configuration application** during job execution was BROKEN (core functionality level) ‚ùå

**The disconnect was between:**
1. **Configuration storage** (working) ‚úÖ
2. **Configuration retrieval** during job execution (broken) ‚ùå
3. **Configuration application** during job execution (broken) ‚ùå
4. **Rerun logic** interaction with configurations (broken) ‚ùå

**‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:**
The rerun system was calling `rerunJobExecution()` which corrupted original jobs and used old configurations instead of getting the current configuration from the database. By fixing the rerun logic to create new execution records and fetch current configurations, all three issues were resolved.

## Current Status: Image Generation Working, Frontend Integration Issues üö®

### **‚úÖ RECENTLY FIXED:**
- **Image Generation Pipeline**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Images are generated and saved to database
- **Database Integration**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Images save successfully with unique mapping IDs
- **QC Status Updates**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Quality checks can update image statuses
- **Main Dashboard Filtering**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Only approved images shown on main dashboard

### **‚ùå CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES:**

**Single Job View Issues:**
- [ ] **Job settings not loading** - Configuration not displayed in Single Job View
- [ ] **Logs not showing** - Job execution logs not appearing in Single Job View
- [ ] **Image statuses inconsistent** - Status mismatch between Single Job View and Dashboard

**Dashboard Log Issues:**
- [ ] **Logs not working** - Job execution logs not appearing on Dashboard
- [ ] **Log export feature broken** - Log export functionality not working
- [ ] **Real-time log updates missing** - No live log streaming during job execution

**Failed Images Panel Issues:**
- [ ] **Failed images not showing** - Failed images not appearing in Failed Images Review panel
- [ ] **Panel data loading broken** - Failed images query not returning results

### **üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
**The Issue:** While the **backend pipeline is now working perfectly**, the **frontend components are not properly connected** to display the data.

**What's Working:**
1. ‚úÖ **PiAPI integration** - Images generated successfully
2. ‚úÖ **Database saving** - Images stored with unique IDs
3. ‚úÖ **Quality checks** - QC status updates working
4. ‚úÖ **Data flow** - Backend to database working

**What's Broken:**
1. ‚ùå **Frontend data loading** - Components not fetching data correctly
2. ‚ùå **IPC communication** - Some frontend-backend calls failing
3. ‚ùå **Data display logic** - UI not showing available data
4. ‚ùå **Real-time updates** - No live data refresh
3. ‚ùå **Multiple BackendAdapter instances** caused handler registration errors
4. ‚ùå **No job data persisted** to database

**What We Fixed:**
1. ‚úÖ **Removed duplicate BackendAdapter instantiation** in jobRunner
2. ‚úÖ **Implemented global instance sharing** to prevent IPC conflicts
3. ‚úÖ **Added database save calls** for job executions and images
4. ‚úÖ **Resolved IPC handler conflicts** completely

**Current Status:** IPC conflicts resolved, database integration enabled. Ready for testing.
2. ‚úÖ **Images are processed and saved to disk**
3. ‚ùå **Job execution data is NEVER saved to database**
4. ‚ùå **Frontend queries empty database** ‚Üí Shows no data
5. ‚ùå **Result: Complete data blackout across all dashboards**

**Technical Details:**
- **JobRunner** creates job IDs and processes images
- **But never calls** `saveJobExecution()` or database methods
- **Database remains empty** even after successful jobs
- **Frontend components** work correctly but have no data to display

### **üîç Root Cause Analysis:**

**The Problem:** While we fixed the backend image generation pipeline, the **frontend is not receiving or displaying the data** that the backend is generating.

**Likely Causes:**
1. **IPC communication issues** between frontend and backend
2. **Database queries not working** in the frontend components
3. **Mock data still being used** instead of real backend data
4. **Data transformation issues** between backend and frontend
5. **Component state management problems** in React components
6. **üö® CRITICAL: JobRunner not saving to database** (NEWLY DISCOVERED)

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Key Files Modified:**
- `src/services/jobRunner.js` - Core fixes for aspect ratio and image handling

### **Critical Code Changes:**

#### **Aspect Ratio Fix in generateParameters:**
```javascript
// Ensure aspectRatios is always an array
let aspectRatios = config.parameters?.aspectRatios || ['1:1'];
if (typeof aspectRatios === 'string') {
  aspectRatios = [aspectRatios]; // Convert string to array
} else if (!Array.isArray(aspectRatios)) {
  aspectRatios = ['1:1']; // Fallback to default
}
```

#### **Image Object Structure Fix in generateImages:**
```javascript
// Get the correct aspect ratio for this image
let aspectRatio;
if (parameters.aspectRatios && parameters.aspectRatios.length > 0) {
  if (parameters.aspectRatios.length === 1) {
    // Single aspect ratio - use for all images
    aspectRatio = parameters.aspectRatios[0];
  } else {
    // Multiple aspect ratios - cycle through them
    aspectRatio = parameters.aspectRatios[index % parameters.aspectRatios.length];
  }
} else {
  // Fallback to default
  aspectRatio = '1:1';
}
```

### **Debugging Enhancements:**
- Added logging for config extraction
- Added logging for parameter generation flow
- Added logging for image object creation
- Added logging for aspect ratio assignment

## Testing Results

### **‚úÖ Tested and Working:**
- **Aspect ratio configuration:** `16:9` now correctly applied to all images
- **Multiple image generation:** 4 images generated with correct aspect ratios
- **Quality checks:** No more crashes due to invalid image paths
- **Parameter passing:** All configuration settings properly applied
- **API integration:** PiAPI calls working with correct aspect ratios

### **üîç Test Scenarios Completed:**
1. **Single aspect ratio (16:9)** ‚Üí All 4 images use 16:9 ‚úÖ
2. **Configuration loading** ‚Üí All settings properly loaded ‚úÖ
3. **Image generation pipeline** ‚Üí Complete pipeline working ‚úÖ
4. **Quality check system** ‚Üí Receiving proper image paths ‚úÖ
5. **Metadata generation** ‚Üí Working correctly ‚úÖ

   - **Solution**: Implemented universal cross-platform path resolution that works on all operating systems
   - **Files Modified**: 
     - `src/database/models/JobConfiguration.js`
     - `src/database/models/JobExecution.js` 
     - `src/database/models/GeneratedImage.js`
   - **Approach**: 
     - Primary: Electron's `app.getPath('userData')` (cross-platform)
     - Fallback: OS-agnostic hidden folder in home directory (`.gen-image-factory/`)
     - Development: Project-relative paths
     - Last resort: `__dirname`-based paths
   - **Result**: App now works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without hardcoded paths

2. **Excel Export Settings Display** - FIXED
