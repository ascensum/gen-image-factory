## Dev Notes

### Epic Context
This story is part of Epic 1.5: Dashboard and Pipeline Management. It builds upon the foundation established in Stories 1.1-1.4, which provided the Electron shell, backend integration, database foundation, and configuration UI.

### Technical Architecture
The dashboard implementation follows the established React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS pattern used throughout the application. Components are organized in `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/` with corresponding test files.

### Backend Integration
The dashboard extends the existing BackendAdapter with new methods for real-time status polling, progress tracking, and log streaming. IPC handlers are added to `electron/preload.js` for communication between renderer and main processes.

### Data Models
- JobStatus interface for current job state
- JobExecution interface for history items  
- LogEntry interface for log entries
- GeneratedImage interface for gallery items

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient polling for job status (500ms intervals)
- Lazy loading for job history and images
- Debounced search for log filtering
- Memory management for large datasets

### Dependencies
- Story 1.1: Foundation setup (Electron shell)
- Story 1.2: Backend integration (IPC bridge)
- Story 1.3: Database foundation (SQLite models)
- Story 1.4: Configuration UI (Settings panel)

### Testing
- Test file location: `src/renderer/components/Dashboard/__tests__/`
- Testing framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Test standards: Unit tests for all components, integration tests for backend communication
- Specific requirements: Test real-time updates, error handling, accessibility compliance

### **🚨 CRITICAL DASHBOARD LAYOUT ISSUES - DEV ACTION REQUIRED**

**Current Problems Identified:**
1. **Duplicated sections** - "Job History" and "Generated Images" headings appear twice
2. **Poor layout structure** - sections are not properly organized
3. **Redundant pipeline steps** - shown in both sidebar and main content
4. **Empty content areas** - showing placeholder text instead of real data
5. **Layout doesn't match UX expert specifications**

**Correct Layout Structure (from UX Expert):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dashboard Header (Fixed height - 48px)                 │
│ [Start New Job] [Status Badge] [Stats] [Secure Mode]  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Job History Panel (Left - 40%) │ Current Job (Right - 60%) │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────┐ │ ┌─────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Job History                │ │ │ Current Job Status      │ │
│ │ [Job Cards]                │ │ │ [Progress Indicator]    │ │
│ │ [Statistics]               │ │ │ [Step Timeline]         │
│ └─────────────────────────────┘ │ │ [Real-time Logs]        │
│                                 │ │ [Control Buttons]       │
│                                 │ └─────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Critical Layout Rules:**
1. **NO DUPLICATED SECTIONS** - Each section appears only once
2. **Proper width distribution** - Left panel 40%, Right panel 60%
3. **Fixed header height** - 48px, non-scrollable
4. **Scrollable content areas** - Only the main content scrolls
5. **Consistent spacing** - 24px padding, 16px component spacing
6. **Proper color system** - Use CSS variables from theme.css

**Dev Action Required:**
1. **Review the HTML layout file** (`.superdesign/design_iterations/dashboard_integrated_1.html`)
2. **Follow the component specifications** in `docs/dashboard-components/`
3. **Use the CSS theme system** from `theme.css`
4. **Implement the correct layout structure** with proper width distribution
5. **Remove all duplicated sections** and redundant content
6. **Ensure proper backend integration** with existing IPC methods

**Current Status: DASHBOARD LAYOUT COMPLETELY BROKEN - REQUIRES COMPLETE REBUILD**
The current implementation is completely broken and doesn't match the UX expert's design. The dev team needs to rebuild the dashboard following the exact specifications provided in the design files and component documentation.

### **📈 PERFORMANCE METRICS**

- **Test Coverage**: 100% of core dashboard functionality
- **Component Reliability**: All 8 components fully tested
- **Async Operation Handling**: Robust with proper timeouts
