# Story 1.10: UI Visual Cleanup & Consistency (BMAD)

## Status
Planned

## Scope
- Address visual inconsistencies and responsiveness across Dashboard, Job Management, Single Job View and Settings.
- Non-functional polish: spacing, alignment, badges, typography, input behavior.

## Goals
- Consistent status badges (colors, shapes, labeling) across all views
- Responsive header in Dashboard (wrap controls into second row on small widths)
- Job Management search/filter header overflow fix
- Add file picker buttons to Single Job View edit (reuse `FileSelector`)
- Stable inputs: no scroll jumps on numeric; stable focus on text
- Uniform field widths and helper text styling in Settings Panel
- Gallery search UX and empty-state messaging
- Single Job View stats layout: spacing and approved/QC Failed breakdown

## Tasks
- Status badges
  - Standardize badge colors and styles in: Dashboard, Job Management, Single Job View, Failed Images Review
- Responsive header (Dashboard)
  - Increase header height; wrap actions to row 2 below a threshold
- Job Management header
  - Fix overflow for search + filters on narrow widths
- Single Job View edit
  - Reuse `FileSelector` (systemPromptFile, keywordsFile, qualityCheckPromptFile, metadataPromptFile)
- Inputs behavior
  - Prevent numeric field scroll jumps; ensure stable focus for text inputs
- Settings uniformity
  - Align widths; unify helper/error text; ensure toggles reflect instantly
- Gallery UX
  - Improve search clarity; add empty-state messages
- Stats layout
  - Tidy spacing; show approved vs QC Failed breakdown

## Acceptance
- Visual review across all views at 3 widths (â‰¥1280px, ~1024px, ~800px)
- Badges visually consistent; headers do not overflow; inputs behave properly
- Single Job View edit includes file pickers and consistent controls

## Notes
- Derived from Story 1.9 closure review on 2025-09-15.
