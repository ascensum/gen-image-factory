# Story 1.10: UI Visual Cleanup & Consistency

## Status
Planned

## Scope
- Address visual inconsistencies and responsiveness across Dashboard, Job Management, Single Job View and Settings.
- Non-functional polish: spacing, alignment, badges, typography, input behavior.

## Goals
- Consistent status badges (colors, shapes, labeling) across all views
- Responsive header in Dashboard (wrap controls into second row on small widths)
- Job Management search/filter header overflow fix
- Add file picker buttons to Single Job View edit (reuse `FileSelector`)
- Stable inputs: no scroll jumps on numeric; stable focus on text
- Uniform field widths and helper text styling in Settings Panel
- Gallery search UX and empty-state messaging
- Single Job View stats layout: spacing and approved/QC Failed breakdown

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Status badges: Standardize colors and styles in Dashboard, Job Management, Single Job View, Failed Images Review
- [ ] Dashboard responsive header: increase header height; wrap actions to second row under threshold
- [ ] Job Management header overflow: fix search + filters layout on narrow widths
- [ ] Single Job View edit parity: use `FileSelector` for systemPromptFile, keywordsFile, qualityCheckPromptFile, metadataPromptFile
- [x] Inputs behavior: prevent numeric field scroll jumps; ensure stable text input focus across tabs/modals
- [ ] Enable Save button onChange and support Enter-to-save (no auto-save).”
- [ ] Settings panel uniformity: align field widths; unify helper/error styles; prevent 'Save Settings' and 'Reset to Defaults' shift left whem 'You have unsaved changes' message appears. Message shold be shown in popup or appear positioned so thet it will not affect buttons positions.
- [ ] Gallery UX: improve search hint and empty-state message
- [ ] Single Job View stats layout: adjust spacing/typography; show approved vs QC Failed breakdown

## Acceptance
- Visual review across all views at 3 widths (≥1280px, ~1024px, ~800px)
- Badges visually consistent; headers do not overflow; inputs behave properly
- Single Job View edit includes file pickers and consistent controls

## Notes
- Derived from Story 1.9 closure review on 2025-09-15.
