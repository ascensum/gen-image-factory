# Story 1.11: Security Hardening - Implement Basic Security Measures for Single User

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As a** single user of the desktop application,
**I want** my API keys to be stored securely with basic protection measures,
**so that** my sensitive data is protected without unnecessary enterprise-level complexity.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. API keys are encrypted in database when keytar is unavailable
2. API keys are cleared from memory on application exit
3. Basic error handling for security failures is implemented
4. User is informed about security status and storage method
5. Graceful fallback maintains functionality when security features fail
6. Security measures are simple and appropriate for single-user context

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement API Key Encryption
  - [ ] Add simple encryption for API keys in database
  - [ ] Implement encryption key generation from system entropy
  - [ ] Add database encryption/decryption utilities
  - [ ] Update JobConfiguration model to handle encrypted API keys
  - [ ] Add basic encryption key management

- [ ] Implement Basic Memory Protection
  - [ ] Clear API keys from memory on application exit
  - [ ] Mask API keys in console logs and error messages
  - [ ] Implement basic secure string handling for API keys
  - [ ] Add memory clearing for sensitive data in transit

- [ ] Add Security Status UI
  - [ ] Create security status indicator component
  - [ ] Show storage method (keytar/encrypted-db/session-only)
  - [ ] Inform user about security level
  - [ ] Add security status to settings panel

- [ ] Update BackendAdapter for Security
  - [ ] Integrate encrypted API key storage as fallback
  - [ ] Add basic error handling for security failures
  - [ ] Implement security status checking
  - [ ] Update error handling for security failures

- [ ] Add Security Configuration
  - [ ] Create simple security status monitoring
  - [ ] Add development vs production security modes
  - [ ] Implement basic security feature toggles
  - [ ] Create security status display

## Technical Specifications

### API Key Encryption
```typescript
interface ApiKeyEncryption {
  encryptApiKeys(apiKeys: object): string;
  decryptApiKeys(encryptedData: string): object;
  generateEncryptionKey(): Promise<string>;
  validateEncryption(): boolean;
}
```

### Basic Memory Protection
```typescript
interface BasicMemoryProtection {
  clearApiKeys(): void;
  maskApiKeysInLogs(str: string): string;
  clearSensitiveData(): void;
}
```

### Security Status
```typescript
interface SecurityStatus {
  getStorageMethod(): 'keytar' | 'encrypted-db' | 'session-only' | 'none';
  getSecurityLevel(): 'secure' | 'fallback' | 'insecure';
  getUserMessage(): string;
}
```

## Dependencies
- **Story 1.2**: Backend Integration (COMPLETED) - Provides foundation
- **Story 1.4**: Settings UI (COMPLETED) - Provides configuration interface
- **Database Layer**: Requires basic encryption library
- **Memory Protection**: Simple memory clearing utilities

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for API key encryption/decryption
- Integration tests for encrypted database operations
- Basic security status tests
- Performance tests for encryption overhead
- Cross-platform security tests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] API key encryption working on all platforms
- [ ] Basic memory protection preventing key exposure
- [ ] Security status UI showing storage method
- [ ] Security features configurable for development
- [ ] Performance impact acceptable (<5% overhead)
- [ ] Security documentation complete
- [ ] All security tests passing

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: API key encryption implementation
- **Low Risk**: Basic memory protection
- **Low Risk**: Security status UI
- **Mitigation**: Implement incrementally with fallbacks

## Story Points
**Estimated**: 5 points (Simplified story for single-user context)

## Priority
**Medium** - Important for security but not blocking current functionality

## Removed Enterprise Features
The following enterprise-level features have been removed as they are unnecessary for a single-user application:
- ❌ Key rotation policies (users manage their own keys)
- ❌ Access logging and audit trails (no multi-user access)
- ❌ Advanced memory protection (no memory attacks expected)
- ❌ Security health checks (enterprise monitoring feature)
- ❌ Key usage analytics (unnecessary complexity)
- ❌ Complex audit trail systems (single user context)
