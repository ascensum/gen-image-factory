# Story 2.7: Microsoft Store Identity Migration

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** project maintainer,  
**I want** to migrate Microsoft Store identity from personal account to Shiftline Tools organization identity,  
**so that** the application is properly branded and configured under the Shiftline Tools organization.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **New Store Identity Creation**:
   - Create new Microsoft Store identity connected to Shiftline Tools brand
   - Obtain new Identity Name, Publisher ID, and Store ID
   - Verify identity in Microsoft Partner Center

2. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Update `package.json#build.appx` with new identity properties:
     - `identityName`: New Store identity name
     - `publisher`: New Publisher ID (CN=...)
     - `publisherDisplayName`: "Shiftline Tools" (unchanged)
   - Update `docs/microsoft-store-guide.md` with new identity
   - Update `docs/prd/technical-constraints-and-integration-requirements.md` Microsoft Store Identity Profile section
   - Update `docs/prd/organizational-structure-and-brand-identity.md` with new identity
   - Update `docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md` if needed

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document identity migration process
   - Document new identity properties
   - Update all references to old identity
   - Create migration checklist

4. **Validation**:
   - Verify MSIX package builds with new identity
   - Verify package can be submitted to Store with new identity
   - Test that old identity references are removed/updated

## Scope

- **In scope**:
  - Update all configuration files with new identity
  - Update all documentation with new identity
  - Validate build and submission process
  - Document migration process

- **Out of scope**:
  - Actual Store submission (manual step)
  - Store listing content (separate task)
  - New Store identity creation (manual step in Partner Center)
