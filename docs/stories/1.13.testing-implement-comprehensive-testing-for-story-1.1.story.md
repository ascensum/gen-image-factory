# Story 1.10: Testing - Implement Comprehensive Testing for Story 1.1

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive testing implemented for the Electron foundation setup from Story 1.1,
**so that** the basic Electron shell, React components, IPC communication, and development workflow are thoroughly validated and maintainable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit tests cover all React components from Story 1.1
2. Integration tests validate IPC communication between main and renderer processes
3. End-to-end tests verify basic app functionality and user interactions
4. TypeScript type safety is validated through comprehensive type checking
5. Development workflow tests confirm hot reload and build processes
6. Cross-platform compatibility tests verify functionality on Windows, macOS, and Linux
7. Security tests validate IPC communication security and contextBridge implementation
8. Performance tests ensure responsive UI during development and production builds

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion notes:
- Electron main process and renderer process are set up and communicating via IPC
- Basic React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS structure is established
- Vite is configured for development and build processes
- Basic IPC communication bridge is implemented in `electron/preload.js`
- All source files are in `src/renderer/` to prevent build deletion
- Security measures implemented with CSP and Electron security settings

### Testing Framework Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests using Vitest with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for IPC communication and component interactions
- End-to-end tests using Playwright for Electron app testing
- TypeScript type checking and validation
- Cross-platform testing for Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Test File Locations
Based on testing strategy [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Unit tests**: `tests/unit/frontend/components/` for React components
- **Integration tests**: `tests/integration/api/` for IPC communication
- **E2E tests**: `tests/e2e/workflows/` for complete app workflows
- **Test utilities**: `tests/test-utils/` for shared testing utilities

### Component Specifications
**React Components to Test** [Source: Story 1.1 Dev Notes]:
- `src/renderer/App.jsx` - Main React component with IPC communication
- `src/renderer/main.jsx` - React entry point with createRoot
- `src/renderer/index.css` - Base CSS with Tailwind directives

### IPC Communication Testing
**IPC Bridge Testing** [Source: Story 1.1 Dev Notes]:
- `electron/preload.js` - contextBridge implementation
- `electron/main.js` - Main process IPC handlers
- Secure channel whitelisting and validation
- Error handling for IPC communication

### Technical Constraints
**Testing Environment** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Vitest for unit and integration testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- TypeScript for type safety validation
- Cross-platform testing requirements

**Performance Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests should complete in under 30 seconds
- Integration tests should complete in under 2 minutes
- E2E test suite should complete in under 10 minutes
- Test parallelization for optimized execution

### Security Testing Requirements
**Security Validation** [Source: Story 1.1 QA Results]:
- ContextBridge security implementation
- Node integration disabled in renderer process
- Content Security Policy (CSP) validation
- Secure channel whitelisting
- Context isolation and sandboxing

### File Locations
Based on project structure and testing strategy:
- **New test files to create**:
  - `tests/unit/frontend/components/App.test.tsx` - App component tests
  - `tests/unit/frontend/components/main.test.tsx` - Entry point tests
  - `tests/integration/api/ipc.test.ts` - IPC communication tests
  - `tests/e2e/workflows/basic-app-functionality.e2e.test.ts` - E2E tests
  - `tests/test-utils/electron-test-utils.ts` - Electron testing utilities
  - `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration for testing
  - `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration for E2E testing

### Testing Configuration
**Vitest Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Environment: jsdom for React component testing
- Setup files for test environment configuration
- Coverage reporting with thresholds
- TypeScript support and path mapping

**Playwright Configuration** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Electron app testing configuration
- Cross-platform testing setup
- Trace recording for debugging
- Parallel test execution

### Test Data Management
**Test Data Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Use factories and fixtures for consistent test data
- Clean up test data after each test
- Avoid hardcoded test values
- Use environment-specific test configurations

### Accessibility Testing
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]:
- Keyboard navigation support testing
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Focus management and ARIA labels testing
- High contrast mode support testing

## Testing
- **Test Approach**: Comprehensive testing covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - Electron app launches successfully on all platforms
  - IPC communication works securely between processes
  - React components render correctly with TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS styles are applied properly
  - Vite development server works with hot reload
  - Build process creates production-ready files
  - Security measures are properly implemented
- **Success Criteria**: All tests pass, app functions correctly on all platforms, security validated
- **Special Testing Considerations**: Cross-platform compatibility, security validation, performance optimization
