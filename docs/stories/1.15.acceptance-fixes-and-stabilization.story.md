# Story 1.15: Acceptance Fixes & Stabilization

## Status
Completed

## Story
As a product owner,
I want the acceptance-test issues fixed and critical flows stabilized,
so that the app behaves predictably and honors user settings across all primary scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Blocking and Major issues listed below are resolved with verifiable behavior in the UI and filesystem.
2. All fixes include targeted tests where feasible and manual verification notes.
3. No regressions in working PNG generation, queueing, exports, settings persistence, and UI responsiveness.
4. Logged errors are actionable and do not contain sensitive data.

## Issues To Resolve (Confirmed)

### Scope Additions Implemented
- As-run configuration snapshots:
  - Execution-level `configurationSnapshot` is captured at job start (excluding API keys).
  - Single Job View Overview shows snapshot settings for the execution.
  - Image modals (“Processing” tab) prefer per-image `processingSettings` when a retry with custom settings was used; otherwise, they show the execution snapshot to reflect as-run settings.
- Runware Advanced gating:
  - A `runwareAdvancedEnabled` flag controls inclusion of advanced parameters (CFG Scale, Steps, Scheduler, NSFW, LoRA).
  - When disabled, advanced parameters are removed on save and sanitized at execution time and in reruns.
  - UI hides the Runware Advanced section if nothing is enabled.
- Local file URL handling:
  - Introduced `buildLocalFileUrl` to standardize `local-file:///` URLs for cross-platform rendering of images in the renderer process.
- Image conversion and quality model:
  - Added WEBP conversion end-to-end (Settings, Single Job View Edit, Failed Images Review Retry, processing pipeline, snapshots, and UI display).
  - PNG conversion is kept lossless (no PNG quality control anywhere).
  - JPG and WEBP have independent quality controls. Defaults are JPG=85, WEBP=85 when not set by user.
  - UI behavior:
    - Settings: Convert Format includes PNG/JPG/WEBP. Show JPG Quality only when JPG selected; show WebP Quality only when WEBP selected.
    - Single Job View Edit: same controls and conditional visibility as Settings.
    - Failed Images Review Retry (custom): same controls and conditional visibility; values are persisted and applied on retry.
  - Display behavior:
    - Image modals’ “Processing” tab only shows JPG Quality if convert=JPG and Image Convert=ON; only shows WebP Quality if convert=WEBP and Image Convert=ON; no PNG quality is shown.
    - Single Job View “Overview”:
      - Image Settings: “Format” rendered uppercase; “Convert to JPG” removed.
      - Processing Options: “Convert Format” shows PNG/JPG/WEBP; JPG/WebP quality shown only when applicable; PNG Quality removed; “Trim Transparent” shows “Not applied (Remove Background OFF)” when removal is OFF.
  - Retry fixes:
    - Original-settings retry now honors convertToWebp/webpQuality (no accidental JPG).
    - Custom retry with metadata and changed WebP quality uses WEBP with the chosen quality; final extension and snapshot reflect WEBP settings.

### Blocking
- JPG/JPEG/WEBP saved as .png despite provider generating correct formats
  - Accept: Correct extension preserved and saved without unintended conversion.

### Major
- Output path ignored for standard runs and reruns (Desktop fallback appears); Retry uses configured path correctly
  - Accept: All flows honor configured generated path; fallback only on explicit error with visible warning.
- Date filter logic incorrect when only start date is set
  - Accept: Start-only filters [start, now]; End-only filters [min, end]; combined works.
- Orphaned "Running" jobs on network loss during generation stage
  - Accept: Jobs transition to Failed or are recoverable; no stuck "Running" entries.
- Orphaned job after app quit during active run
  - Accept: On startup, any "Running" without worker becomes Failed with Retry available.
- "Has pending retries" filter does nothing in Job Management
  - Accept: Shows only parent jobs awaiting retry spawn when checked.
- Remove.bg size ignored (uses "auto" regardless of selected value across Settings, Single Job Edit, Retry custom)
  - Accept: Selected size is honored end-to-end.
- Image Gallery → Single Image Modal "Processing" tab not reflecting latest edits from Edit modal
  - Accept: Processing tab shows up-to-date processing settings after edits, without reopening the modal. Also validate the same in Failed Images Review Single Image Modal.

### Minor / UX
- Single Job View export uses old UI instead of new export modal
  - Accept: Uses same modal flow as Job Management Export Selected; single-job exports .xlsx.
- QC Retry (custom) causes flashing; also when "add metadata" is selected
  - Accept: Smooth state update; no visible flicker.
- Retry modal (Failed Image Review): Remove.bg size options incomplete
  - Accept: Options match Settings dropdown exactly.
- Retry modal (Failed Image Review): Enhancement controls are text fields instead of sliders
  - Accept: Uses same slider components as Settings for sharpening/saturation.
- PNG conversion quality control is misleading
  - Accept: Hide or disable PNG quality input when Convert Format = PNG; provide brief helper text if needed.

### New
- WebP support and trimming alignment
  - Add conversion to .webp via sharp; reuse PNG Quality field as WebP Quality (rename label to “WebP Quality” when WebP selected).
  - Ensure Remove Background + Trim Transparent behaviors remain gated by Remove.bg = ON (no provider-specific alpha-trim).

### Needs Investigation
- Intermittent backend error on app launch
  - Accept: Root-caused and resolved; clean cold start.

### Not in Scope / Clarified
- Retry-on-connectivity-restore partially works before generation stage; tracked by orphaning during generation.
- API quota/429 handling not required for this story unless requirements change.
- Backup manager not a requirement; out of scope.

### Completed: Generation stability and timeouts
- [x] Honor Generation Timeout enable flag across all networked operations
  - [x] Default to 30s when `enablePollingTimeout` is false (Runware POSTs, image downloads, remove.bg calls)
- [x] Add per‑generation parameter generation timeout (multi‑gen runs)
  - [x] Wrap per‑gen param gen with `withTimeout` to prevent orphaned jobs when Wi‑Fi is cut before later gens

### Completed: Remove.bg failure behavior setting
- [x] Add setting “On remove.bg failure: Approve (soft) / Mark Failed (Technical)”
  - [x] Visible under Remove Background toggle in Settings panel
  - [x] Visible in Single Job View Edit modal under Remove Background
- [x] Backend passes selected mode to processing pipeline
- [x] Processing honors mode:
  - [x] Mark Failed → image tagged `qc_failed` with `qcReason=processing_failed:remove_bg`
  - [x] Approve (soft) → continue; record `metadata.failure={stage:'remove_bg', vendor:'remove.bg', message}` on the image
 
### Completed: Remove.bg "Mark Failed" Stabilization
- [x] Fix "Zombie Image" state where failed Remove.bg (in Mark Failed mode) prevented file move but left status as Approved.
  - [x] Implement comprehensive guards in `JobRunner` to force `qc_failed` status when Remove.bg fails.
  - [x] Add "Global Guard" `[v5]` to catch any image that didn't reach final state during processing and force `qc_failed`.
  - [x] Ensure successful images (moved to final) are untouched by failure guards.
  - [x] Verify logic handles "QC Disabled" (technical failure still stops flow) and "QC Failed" (processing skipped entirely) correctly.
  - [x] Add structured logging `[v4]/[v5]` tags for verification.
  - [x] Refactor logging: remove temporary debug tags and reduce verbosity; elevate critical failure guards to 'warn' level.

### Completed: LoRA UX and Parsing Fixes
- [x] Fix LoRA parsing delimiter conflict
  - [x] Change delimiter to comma (`,`) for `model,weight`
  - [x] Implement robust parsing heuristic (comma first, then last colon check)
  - [x] Update helper texts and placeholders in Settings and Single Job View
- [x] Fix LoRA UI display regressions
  - [x] Display "Not Applied as LoRA Models disabled" when toggle is OFF
  - [x] Use comma delimiter in Overview display
- [x] Fix LoRA list editing in Single Job View

  - [x] Allow multiline editing without aggressive re-formatting

### New (UI/state consistency follow-ups)
- [x] Unify image status labels between Single Job View, header status badge, and Image tab filters
  - [x] Ensure identical status mapping/normalization across components
  - [x] Verify filters use the same normalized set and labels
  - [x] Update header statistics label text to match list/badges
 
### New (Retry behavior customization)
- [x] Add "Fail Retry" toggle to "Retry with custom options" modal
  - [x] When OFF: keep current defaults (Remove.bg soft, Trim hard, Convert/Save hard, Metadata soft, Enhancement soft except encode failures)
  - [x] When ON: show multi-select for steps that should hard-fail retry (Remove.bg, Trim, Enhancement, Convert/Save, Metadata)
  - [x] When ON and no steps selected: all steps are soft-fail (user responsibility)
- [x] Wire retry executor to respect selected fail-on steps
  - [x] Remove.bg: if selected, mark failed_retry on error/timeout; else soft-fail (continue)
  - [x] Trim: if selected, failed_retry on error; else soft-fail (continue)
  - [x] Enhancement: if selected, validate post-enhancement via sharpInstance.clone().toBuffer(); on error → failed_retry "Enhancement failed"; if not selected, skip enhancement on error (soft)
  - [x] Convert/Save: if selected, failed_retry on encode/write/move error; else soft-fail (continue)
  - [x] Metadata: if selected, failed_retry on error; else soft-fail (continue)
- [x] Badge/Reason mapping
  - [x] Ensure failed_retry shows step-specific reason label (e.g., "Enhancement failed", "Metadata failed")
  - [x] Export reason remains compatible with existing qcReason mappings
  
### Completed: WebP and Processing UX
- [x] Add WebP conversion via sharp; introduce WebP Quality (1–100), default 85
- [x] Keep PNG conversion lossless; remove PNG Quality controls from UI and displays
- [x] Surface WEBP/JPG quality conditionally in Settings, Single Job View Edit, Retry modal
- [x] Fix retry flows to respect WEBP conversion/quality; ensure snapshots and modals show correct values
- [x] Add qcReason mapping and UI labels for trim failures (`processing_failed:trim`)
 - [x] Single Job View: Images tab badges use qcReason labels (e.g., "Metadata failed"); dropdown filter supports specific qcReason categories
 - [x] Single Job View: Generated Images Summary label changed from "QC Failed" to "Failed Processing"

### Completed: Retry failure handling (retry_failed)
- [x] Map Convert hard-fails to `processing_failed:convert`
- [x] Map Save/move hard-fails to `processing_failed:save_final`
- [x] Map Metadata hard-fails to `processing_failed:metadata` (with heuristic fallback when stage is missing); UI badge shows “Metadata failed”
- [x] Preserve original source during retry processing (`preserveInput=true` in `processImage`)
- [x] Add deletion guard: delete source only if it lives under temp/generated and differs from final
- [x] Wrap long Failure Reason text in Failed Image Review modal (no overflow)
- [x] Badges: show “Conversion failed”/“Save failed” based on qcReason; consistent red styling
- [x] Single Job View Images tab: add filters “Failed (All)”, “Failed – QC”, “Failed – Technical”, keep per‑reason filters

### Implemented (Out-of-scope but completed in 1.15)
- [x] Persist execution-level configuration snapshots and surface in UI (Single Job View Overview, Image Modals Processing)
- [x] Prefer per-image `processingSettings` only when retry customized values
- [x] Gate Runware Advanced by `runwareAdvancedEnabled` across Settings, Edit modal, backend saves, rerun execution
- [x] Standardize local file URLs with `buildLocalFileUrl` for renderer image loads
 
## Recent fixes (Failed job handling and paths)
- Local-file URL 404s on macOS:
  - Main-process protocol handler now normalizes to `local-file:///<absolute-path>` and, on macOS, corrects lowercased `"/users/..."` to `"/Users/..."` before checking the filesystem. This fixes `net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` for URLs like `local-file://users/...`.
- Retry removing the final file after move:
  - In `RetryExecutor.runPostProcessing`, added a guard to delete the original only when `sourcePath !== finalOutputPath`. Previously, if both resolved to the same location, the just-moved file could be deleted, causing gallery/modal 404s after retry.
  - Result: retried images (e.g., IDs 2577/2578, job 817) now appear reliably in Gallery and Modals without missing files.
 - Retry Convert/Save soft‑fallback (locked output directory):
  - When Fail Retry is OFF and the move to final output fails (e.g., permissions/locked path), the executor now falls back to the original source path instead of throwing. We set `processedImagePath/newPath/finalImagePath` to the source, skip deletion of the source, and continue approving.
  - Result: retried images still display in Gallery/Modals (no 404), and the UI remains consistent even under output directory write denials.

### Recent fixes (Retry failure handling – retry_failed)
- Consistent qcReason mapping for Convert/Save:
  - Hard-fail on encode/write now maps to `processing_failed:convert`.
  - Hard-fail on final move (e.g., EACCES/locked output) maps to `processing_failed:save_final`.
  - UI badges render as “Conversion failed” / “Save failed”; filters pick them up by reason.
- Metadata retry failures:
  - When “Fail Retry = ON” and “Metadata” selected, connection/errors map to `processing_failed:metadata`. If upstream didn’t tag a stage, a safe fallback inspects the error and maps accordingly.
  - UI badge renders “Metadata failed”; Failure Reason shows metadata-specific text.
- Preserve original source during retry processing:
  - `processImage` now supports `preserveInput=true` to skip input deletion.
  - Retry path passes `preserveInput`, preventing delayed disappearance after failures.
- Safe deletion guard:
  - Original file is deleted only if it resides inside the temp/generated directory and differs from final; otherwise deletion is skipped.
- Failure Reason display:
  - Long backend error strings are wrapped in the red “Failure reason” box in Failed Image Review modal to avoid overflow.
- Single Job View Images tab filters:
  - Added “Failed (All)”, “Failed – QC”, “Failed – Technical”.
  - Per-reason dynamic filters remain (e.g., `processing_failed:metadata`, `processing_failed:convert`).

### Recent fixes (UI consistency)
- Images filter dropdown (Single Job View):
  - De-duplicated dynamic entries when multiple qcReasons share the same visible label (e.g., avoid double “QC Failed”).
- Overview → Generated Images Summary:
  - “Failed Processing” count now includes both `qc_failed` and `retry_failed`. If image list isn’t loaded yet, falls back to stored execution statistics to keep initial render correct.
- Retry Queue Status (Failed Image Review):
  - Fixed counts (Processing, Completed, Failed) staying at zero. `RetryExecutor` now maintains a `processedJobs` history array alongside the active `queue`, ensuring `getQueueStatus` reports cumulative stats for the current session correctly.
  - Confirmed smooth updates without flickering.

### Recent fixes (Generation stability and timeouts)
- Honor enable/disable of Generation Timeout:
  - Custom timeout is only applied when `enablePollingTimeout = true`. Otherwise default 30s is used for Runware calls, image downloads, and remove.bg.
- Per‑generation timeout (multi‑gen runs):
  - Wrapped per‑generation parameter generation with `withTimeout` (30s default, or user‑set when enabled) to prevent orphaned jobs if Wi‑Fi is cut before later generations.
- Partial success finalize:
  - Fixed undefined `imagesPerTask` in last‑gen failure path; now uses `effectiveVariationsForGen` to count failures, preserving earlier successful generations and finalizing the job.
- Remove.bg failure handling:
  - On timeout/connection errors, per‑image qcReason maps to `processing_failed:remove_bg`; job proceeds and finalizes (no stuck “Running”).
- QC per‑image timeout:
  - Wrapped `aiVision.runQualityCheck` in `withTimeout`. Each QC call now times out at Generation Timeout (when enabled) or 30s default, per image.
  - Finalize settle window remains unchanged (dynamic 5s per image).

### Completed: LoRA Models (first‑class, API‑aligned)
- [x] Settings: Added “LoRA Models” toggle under Runware Settings (after Output Format) with helper text; reveals “LoRA list (model:weight per line)” when ON.
- [x] Removed LoRA input from Runware Advanced block; advanced toggle no longer gates LoRA.
- [x] Backend request uses `lora` array per API and sends only when `loraEnabled = true` and list non‑empty.
- [x] Single Job View (Edit): Added LoRA toggle + list with same behavior as Settings.
- [x] Single Job View (Overview): Under Model Configuration, shows “LoRA Models: Yes/No”; when Yes, shows “LoRA list” as `model:weight` with weight defaulted to 1 if missing; when No, shows “Not Applied as LoRA Models disabled”.
- [x] Execution snapshots/UI displays reflect LoRA state and list as‑run (no API keys).
- [x] Rerun paths preserve LoRA state and list; bulk reruns sanitize/forward correctly.
- [x] Doc reference: Runware Image Inference API — LoRA parameter (`lora` array).

### Manual Acceptance Test – LoRA Models
- [x] Toggle OFF: Run a job with LoRA Models OFF and a non‑empty list; expect no LoRA sent, job completes; Overview shows “LoRA Models: No” and “LoRA list: Not Applied as LoRA Models disabled”.
- [x] Toggle ON + list: Enter multiple lines like:
  - `flux-lora:0.8`
  - `artist-style` (no weight)
  - Expect request includes `lora: [{model:'flux-lora',weight:0.8},{model:'artist-style',weight:1}]`; Overview shows Yes and “flux-lora:0.8, artist-style:1”.
- [x] Snapshot display: After completion, Single Job View Overview and Image Modal “As‑run settings” reflect LoRA Yes and the exact list used.
- [x] Rerun with LoRA OFF: Edit job → turn LoRA Models OFF (leave list filled); rerun; expect no `lora` in request; Overview for rerun shows “No/Not Applied”.
- [x] Bulk rerun: Select multiple jobs with mixed LoRA states; start bulk rerun; expect each rerun respects its own LoRA enabled/list.
- [x] Invalid lines/graceful defaults: Blank lines ignored; weight parsing defaults to 1 for non‑numeric/missing weights; request still valid.

### Planned enhancements
- Excel export: include Job Label/Name and Execution ID columns to simplify filtering by job when exporting multiple jobs together.

- [x] Unit/Integration/E2E tests updated where feasible.
- [x] No sensitive data in logs; errors are actionable.
- [x] Lint/tests green.

## Risks
