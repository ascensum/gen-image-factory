## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.2 (Backend Integration)** already implemented:
- ✅ Basic SQLite database setup and initialization
- ✅ `JobConfiguration` model with CRUD operations
- ✅ Keytar integration for secure credential storage

- ✅ IPC methods for database operations
- ✅ Error handling and translation for database errors

**Story 1.3 Focus**: Complete the missing database components that are needed for full application functionality.

### Data Models
**JobExecution Model** (NEW - not implemented in Story 1.2):
- Links to JobConfiguration via foreign key
- Tracks job execution history and status
- Stores execution metadata and results
- Includes job statistics (total, successful, failed images)

**GeneratedImage Model** (NEW - not implemented in Story 1.2):
- Links to JobExecution via foreign key
- Stores individual image generation results
- Includes metadata and processing settings
- Tracks QC status and failure reasons

### API Specifications
**New Database Operations** (to be added to existing Backend Adapter):
```typescript
// Job Execution Management
async saveJobExecution(execution: JobExecution): Promise<number>;
async getJobExecution(id: number): Promise<JobExecution>;
async getAllJobExecutions(): Promise<JobExecution[]>;
async updateJobExecution(id: number, execution: JobExecution): Promise<void>;
async deleteJobExecution(id: number): Promise<void>;

// Generated Image Management
async saveGeneratedImage(image: GeneratedImage): Promise<number>;
async getGeneratedImage(id: number): Promise<GeneratedImage>;
async getGeneratedImagesByExecution(executionId: number): Promise<GeneratedImage[]>;
async updateGeneratedImage(id: number, image: GeneratedImage): Promise<void>;
async deleteGeneratedImage(id: number): Promise<void>;

// Job History and Statistics
async getJobHistory(): Promise<JobExecution[]>;
async getJobStatistics(): Promise<JobStatistics>;
async getImageMetadata(executionId: number): Promise<GeneratedImage[]>;
```

### Component Specifications
**Database Service Extensions** (to be added to existing implementation):
