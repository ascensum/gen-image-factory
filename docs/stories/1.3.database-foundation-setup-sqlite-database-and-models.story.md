## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.2 (Backend Integration)** already implemented:
- ✅ Basic SQLite database setup and initialization
- ✅ `JobConfiguration` model with CRUD operations
- ✅ Keytar integration for secure credential storage
- ✅ Basic Backend Adapter integration with database
- ✅ IPC methods for database operations
- ✅ Error handling and translation for database errors

**Story 1.3 Focus**: Complete the missing database components that are needed for full application functionality.

### Note on BackupManager (added later, not user-facing)
- `src/database/backupManager.js` was introduced outside this story’s scope and is not wired into runtime flows.
- Potential future use: internal DB snapshotting/testing; not a current user-facing feature.
- Action: Treat as optional/experimental; if we decide to keep it, integrate with a maintainer task/story and add stable test runner support. Otherwise consider removal.

### Data Models
**JobExecution Model** (NEW - not implemented in Story 1.2):
- Links to JobConfiguration via foreign key
- Tracks job execution history and status
- Stores execution metadata and results
- Includes job statistics (total, successful, failed images)

**GeneratedImage Model** (NEW - not implemented in Story 1.2):
- Links to JobExecution via foreign key
- Stores individual image generation results
- Includes metadata and processing settings
- Tracks QC status and failure reasons

### API Specifications
**New Database Operations** (to be added to existing Backend Adapter):
```typescript
// Job Execution Management
async saveJobExecution(execution: JobExecution): Promise<number>;
async getJobExecution(id: number): Promise<JobExecution>;
async getAllJobExecutions(): Promise<JobExecution[]>;
async updateJobExecution(id: number, execution: JobExecution): Promise<void>;
async deleteJobExecution(id: number): Promise<void>;

// Generated Image Management
async saveGeneratedImage(image: GeneratedImage): Promise<number>;
async getGeneratedImage(id: number): Promise<GeneratedImage>;
async getGeneratedImagesByExecution(executionId: number): Promise<GeneratedImage[]>;
async updateGeneratedImage(id: number, image: GeneratedImage): Promise<void>;
async deleteGeneratedImage(id: number): Promise<void>;

// Job History and Statistics
async getJobHistory(): Promise<JobExecution[]>;
async getJobStatistics(): Promise<JobStatistics>;
async getImageMetadata(executionId: number): Promise<GeneratedImage[]>;
```

### Component Specifications
**Database Service Extensions** (to be added to existing implementation):
- Will extend existing `JobConfiguration` model with new tables
- Will integrate with existing Backend Adapter
- Will maintain compatibility with existing database operations
- Will add transaction support for complex operations

  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'running',
  total_images INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  successful_images INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  failed_images INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  error_message TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (configuration_id) REFERENCES job_configurations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_job_executions_configuration_id ON job_executions(configuration_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_job_executions_status ON job_executions(status);

- Cross-platform database compatibility
- Database migration and schema updates

**Performance Tests**:
- Database query performance with large datasets
- Transaction performance for complex operations
- Database backup and recovery performance
- Memory usage optimization

### Risk Assessment
**High Risk**:
- Database migration complexity with existing data
- Foreign key constraint performance impact
- Transaction deadlock scenarios

**Medium Risk**:
- Database performance with large image metadata
- Cross-platform file path handling for image paths
- TypeScript type safety with complex nested objects

**Low Risk**:
- SQLite version compatibility
