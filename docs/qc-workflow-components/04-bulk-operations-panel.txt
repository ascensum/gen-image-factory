SIMPLIFIED BULK OPERATIONS INTEGRATION

COMPONENT PURPOSE
Integrated bulk operations that enhance existing ImageGallery component for failed images review, providing simple bulk actions without over-engineering.

INTEGRATION STRATEGY
- Enhance Existing: Extend current ImageGallery component with failed images bulk operations
- Reuse Components: Leverage existing bulk selection and action infrastructure
- Add QC Features: Minimal additions for bulk approve/retry/delete operations
- Maintain Consistency: Use existing Tailwind CSS patterns and responsive behavior

VISUAL DESIGN
- Base Structure: Same as existing bulk operations in ImageGallery
- QC Enhancements: Bulk approve, retry, and delete for failed images
- Consistent Styling: Follow existing bulk operation patterns and color scheme
- Responsive Layout: Inherit existing responsive behavior

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

Component Enhancement
// Extend existing ImageGallery props
interface FailedImagesGalleryProps extends ImageGalleryProps {
  onBulkApprove: (imageIds: string[], notes?: string) => void;
  onBulkRetry: (imageIds: string[], useOriginalSettings: boolean, modifiedSettings?: ProcessingSettings) => void;
  onBulkDelete: (imageIds: string[]) => void;
}

interface ProcessingSettings {
  imageEnhancement: boolean;
  sharpening: number;
  saturation: number;
  contrast: number;
  removeBackground: boolean;
  removeBgSize: string;
  removeBgQuality: string;
  trimTransparent: boolean;
  trimTolerance: number;
  convertImage: boolean;
  outputFormat: 'jpg' | 'png';
  jpgQuality: number;
  pngQuality: number;
}

Integration Points
- Reuse Selection: Extend existing bulk selection system
- Enhance Actions: Add QC-specific bulk action handlers
- Extend State: Add failed images specific state management
- Maintain UI: Keep existing bulk operations UI patterns
- Add Settings Panel: New configuration panel for modified settings

KEY SIMPLIFICATIONS

NO EXPORT REPORT
- Before: Complex export functionality with multiple formats
- After: No export - approved images go to main dashboard for existing export functionality

NO INDIVIDUAL IMAGE SETTINGS
- Before: Different settings for each image in batch
- After: Batch processing with single setting choice (original OR modified)

NO COMPLEX CONFIGURATION
- Before: Multiple parameter options and workflow steps
- After: Simple choice between original and modified settings

NO PROGRESS TRACKING
- Before: Complex progress bars and operation status
- After: Simple success/error feedback

BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH

1. Faster Development: Enhance existing components rather than create new ones
2. Better Consistency: Maintains visual and behavioral consistency
3. Easier Maintenance: Less code duplication and simpler state management
4. User Familiarity: Users already know how to interact with bulk operations
5. Responsive Design: Automatically inherits existing responsive behavior

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
