# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

* **Deployment Approach**: The application will be packaged into distributable, platform-specific installers using **`electron-builder`**.
* **Auto-Updates**: The **`electron-updater`** module will be used, with **GitHub Releases** serving as the free, open-source-friendly publish provider.
* **Monitoring**: The application will rely on user-submitted bug reports via GitHub Issues, supported by the **"Debug Mode"** logging feature. The application will log detailed errors to a local file when in debug mode.

## Security Deployment Considerations

### Secure Storage Requirements
* **Native OS Keychain**: The application uses `keytar` for secure API key storage in the native OS credential manager
* **Platform Support**: Keychain (macOS), Credential Manager (Windows), Secret Service (Linux)
* **Fallback Strategy**: When keytar is unavailable, the application falls back to plain text storage (development mode)
* **Future Enhancement**: Story 1.11 will implement encrypted database fallback for production environments

### Security Status Communication
* **User Messaging**: The application communicates security status to users through the UI
* **Storage Method Indicators**: Users are informed about the current storage method and security level
* **Development vs Production**: Clear distinction between development (plain text) and production (encrypted) storage

### Memory Protection
* **API Key Handling**: API keys are cleared from memory on application exit
* **Log Masking**: Sensitive data is masked in logs and error messages
* **Secure String Handling**: API key operations use secure string handling practices

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
* **Security Feature Testing**: All security features must be tested across target platforms
* **Credential Manager Integration**: Native OS credential manager integration varies by platform
* **Fallback Mechanism**: Robust fallback mechanisms ensure application functionality across different environments

## Security Monitoring and Logging

### Debug Mode Security
* **Sensitive Data Masking**: Debug logs mask API keys and sensitive information
* **Security Status Logging**: Application logs security status changes and fallback events
* **Error Handling**: Security-related errors are logged with appropriate detail levels

### User Communication
* **Security Status UI**: Real-time security status display in the user interface
* **Storage Method Indicators**: Clear indication of current storage method and security level
* **Future Enhancement Messaging**: Users are informed about upcoming security improvements
