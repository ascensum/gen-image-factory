# Next Steps

This architecture document provides the complete technical blueprint for the enhancement. The next phase is to move to the IDE environment and begin the development cycle by breaking down the epics and stories defined in the PRD into implementation tasks.

## Security Implementation Priorities

### **Story 1.11: Security Hardening (Future Enhancement)**
- **Encrypted Database Fallback**: Implement encrypted database storage when keytar is unavailable
- **Memory Protection**: Add comprehensive memory protection for sensitive data
- **Log Masking**: Implement secure logging that masks API keys and sensitive information
- **Security Monitoring**: Add security health checks and monitoring capabilities

### **Current Security Status (Story 1.2 Complete)**
- ✅ **Native OS Keychain**: Primary secure storage using keytar
- ✅ **Security Status Communication**: UI displays current security level and storage method
- ✅ **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful fallback to plain text storage (development mode)
- ✅ **User Messaging**: Clear communication about security implications

### **Security Testing Requirements**
- **Unit Testing**: Complete security method testing with 100% coverage
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-platform security validation
- **End-to-End Testing**: Security UI behavior across different platforms
- **Performance Testing**: Security operations performance validation

## Implementation Roadmap

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **Story 1.5**: Core Controls UI - Implement job control interface
2. **Story 1.6**: Progress Tracking - Real-time progress display
3. **Story 1.7**: Job History - Database integration for job history
4. **Story 1.8**: Export Functionality - Excel export capabilities

### **Security Enhancement Path**
1. **Story 1.11**: Security Hardening - Encrypted database and memory protection
2. **Security Monitoring**: Add security health checks and alerts
3. **Advanced Security**: Key rotation and advanced security features (if needed)

### **Quality Assurance**
1. **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security testing across all platforms
2. **Performance Testing**: Security operations performance validation
3. **User Experience**: Security status communication and user feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### **Security Risks**
- **Keytar Failures**: Robust fallback mechanisms in place
- **Cross-Platform Issues**: Comprehensive testing across target platforms
- **User Communication**: Clear messaging about security implications

### **Development Risks**
- **Performance Impact**: Security operations optimized for minimal overhead
- **User Experience**: Security features integrated seamlessly into UI
- **Maintenance**: Security code well-documented and maintainable

## Success Criteria

### **Security Success Metrics**
- ✅ Secure storage available on all target platforms
- ✅ Graceful fallback when secure storage unavailable
- ✅ Clear user communication about security status
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in logs or error messages
- ✅ Security operations complete within acceptable performance limits
