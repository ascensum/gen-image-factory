# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview

As defined in the PRD, this enhancement is a **major feature modification** with a **significant** impact on the existing codebase. The scope is to build a user-friendly Electron desktop application UI around the existing Node.js backend logic, and to add a database for persistence.

## Integration Approach

The architecture will be based on Electron's process model to ensure a responsive UI and clean separation of concerns.

* **Process Model**: Your existing Node.js backend logic will run entirely within Electron's **Main Process**. The new User Interface will run in a separate **Renderer Process**.
* **The Backend Adapter (NFR5)**: This is the central component of our integration strategy. It will act as the **sole intermediary** between the UI and your backend modules, exposing a clean API via Electron's secure IPC bridge.
* **Database Integration**: The new database logic will be implemented and accessed exclusively within the Main Process. The Backend Adapter will expose methods to the UI for saving/loading configurations and history.

## Compatibility Requirements

This architecture will adhere to the following compatibility requirements as defined in the PRD:
* The integration of the existing backend modules shall require minimal refactoring of their core logic to function within the Electron environment (CR1).
* The application must support all existing configuration options and workflows through the new UI (CR2).
