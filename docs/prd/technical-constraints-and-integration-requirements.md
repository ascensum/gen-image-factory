# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

The enhancement will be built upon the existing technology stack. New components must be compatible with these core technologies:

| Category | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Runtime** | Node.js (v16+) |
| **AI Integration**| `openai` (^4.52.0) |
| **Image Processing**| `sharp` (^0.32.0) |
| **Data Handling**| `xlsx` (^0.18.5), `csv-parser` (^3.2.0) |
| **HTTP Client** | `axios` (^1.3.1) |

## Integration Approach

* **Process Model**: The application will use Electron's Main Process for the Node.js backend logic and the Renderer Process for the UI.
* **Communication Bridge**: All communication will go through the **Backend Adapter** (NFR5), which will manage asynchronous communication between the two processes.
* **Error Handling**: The Backend Adapter will catch technical errors and translate them into user-friendly messages.

## Code Organization and Standards

A new `/electron` directory will be created to house all UI and Electron-specific code, keeping it separate from the existing `/src` backend logic.

## Deployment and Operations

The final application will be packaged using `electron-builder` to generate distributable installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
