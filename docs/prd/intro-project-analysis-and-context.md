# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

* **Analysis Source**: The primary source for this analysis is the `Brownfield Architecture Document` recently completed by Winston the Architect, which was based on a full review of the project's source code.
* **Current Project State**: The project is a modular Node.js command-line tool that automates a complete AI art generation and post-processing pipeline. It uses PiAPI for Midjourney generation, OpenAI for prompt engineering and Vision-based quality control, and includes advanced features like CSV-based templating and robust image processing.

## Available Documentation Analysis

Based on our previous session, the following documentation is available and will be used as the foundation for this PRD:
* The code-verified `Brownfield Architecture Document`.

## Enhancement Scope Definition

* **Enhancement Type**: This is a major feature modification, effectively creating a new application shell (Electron UI) around the existing core logic.
* **Enhancement Description**: The project will be enhanced by building a user-friendly Electron desktop application UI around the existing Node.js backend logic. The enhancement will also include adding a database for persistence of settings and results.
* **Impact Assessment**: The impact on the existing codebase is **Significant**, as it will require refactoring the core logic to decouple it from the CLI and integrate with an Electron main process and a new database layer.

## Goals and Background Context

* **Goals**:
    1.  To create a user-friendly UI that makes the tool accessible to non-technical users.
    2.  To implement database persistence for key application data (e.g., settings, job history, generated metadata).
    3.  To reuse the existing, powerful backend logic for prompt engineering and image production within the new application.
* **Background Context**: The current CLI tool is powerful but requires technical expertise to operate. Creating an Electron application will broaden its audience and provide a more intuitive workflow, while adding persistence will enable more advanced features and job management in the future.
