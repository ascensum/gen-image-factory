# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## High-Level UI Vision

The primary vision for the UI is to create a clean, modern, and intuitive single-window desktop application that guides non-technical users through the art generation process. The design should prioritize clarity and ease-of-use, abstracting away the complexity of the underlying command-line tool. The workflow should be linear and logical: configure a job, run it, and view the results.

## Core Screens and Views

To meet the functional requirements, the application will be conceptually organized around these core views:
1.  **Configuration View**: A dedicated area where users can manage all settings, select input files, and configure a generation job.
2.  **Dashboard / Run View**: The main control center to start/stop the job, see a progress indicator, and view the user-friendly log.
3.  **Results & History View**: A gallery-style view to display final images, their metadata, QC failure reasons, and historical job results.

## UI Design Principles

* **Clarity over Density**: Avoid overwhelming users with too many options at once.
* **Guided Workflow**: The UI should naturally guide the user through the process: 1. Configure -> 2. Run -> 3. View Results.
* **Immediate Feedback**: Every user action should provide clear and immediate visual feedback.
