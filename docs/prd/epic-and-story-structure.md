# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic 1: CLI to Full Electron Application with UI and Persistence

**Epic Goal**: This epic will deliver a fully functional desktop application with a graphical user interface that encapsulates the existing CLI tool's power, adds database persistence for job history and configurations, and is packaged for easy distribution on major operating systems.

**User Stories (in implementation order):**

1.  **Foundation: Setup Basic Electron Shell**
    - Create Electron main process
    - Setup basic window and renderer process
    - Establish project structure with `/electron` directory
    - Configure Vite for React + TypeScript development
    - Setup Tailwind CSS for styling
    - Implement basic IPC communication

2.  **Backend Integration: Implement Backend Adapter and IPC Bridge**
    - Create Backend Adapter (NFR5) for UI-backend communication
    - Implement secure IPC bridge between processes
    - Integrate existing CLI modules with minimal refactoring (CR1)
    - Setup error handling and user-friendly message translation
    - Configure TypeScript types for IPC communication

3.  **Database Foundation: Setup SQLite Database and Models**
    - Implement SQLite database setup
    - Create JobConfiguration, JobExecution, and GeneratedImage models
    - Setup database service layer
    - Implement secure credential storage with Keytar (NFR2)
    - Define TypeScript interfaces for database models

4.  **Configuration: Implement Application Settings UI - (DONE)**
    - Create settings management interface for all `.env` parameters (FR1)
    - Implement file browser for input files (FR2)
    - Add API key management with secure storage
    - Include cost labeling for API features (FR12)
    - Integrate with database for configuration persistence
    - Style UI components with Tailwind CSS



5.  **Core Controls: Implement Main Dashboard and Pipeline Controls**
    - Create main dashboard with start/stop controls (FR3)
    - Implement real-time progress indicator (FR4)
    - Add dual-mode logging (Standard/Debug) (FR4, FR10)
    - Include force stop all processes button (FR11)
    - Ensure responsive UI during backend processing (NFR1)
    - Style dashboard components with Tailwind CSS

6.  **Results: Implement 'Successful Results' View**
    - Create results gallery view
    - Display images with metadata and QC status (FR5)
    - Implement Excel export functionality (FR8)
    - Add image metadata display
    - Style gallery components with Tailwind CSS

7.  **Review: Implement 'Failed Images' Review Workflow**
    - Create failed images review interface
    - Display QC failure reasons (FR5)
    - Implement manual approval workflow
    - Add retry mechanisms for failed images
    - Style review components with Tailwind CSS

8.  **Persistence: Implement Job History and Advanced Features**
    - Complete job configuration saving (FR6)
    - Implement job results saving with full history (FR7)
    - Create job history view and management
    - Add data export and cleanup features
    - Style history components with Tailwind CSS

9.  **Distribution: Implement Application Packaging**
    - Configure Electron Builder for cross-platform packaging (NFR3)
    - Generate distributable installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux
    - Implement auto-update mechanism
    - Create deployment documentation
    - Optimize Vite build for production

10. **Testing: Implement Comprehensive Testing for Story 1.1**
    - Create unit tests for React components using React Testing Library
    - Implement integration tests for IPC communication
    - Create end-to-end tests for basic app functionality
    - Validate TypeScript type safety and configuration
    - Test cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Implement security tests for IPC and app security
    - Create performance and build optimization tests

**Testing Strategy**: Each story includes comprehensive testing tasks covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation as appropriate for the story scope. TypeScript will provide additional type safety during development. Story 1.10 specifically addresses the testing requirements for the foundational components from Story 1.1.
