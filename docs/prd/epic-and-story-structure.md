# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic 1: CLI to Full Electron Application with UI and Persistence

**Epic Goal**: This epic will deliver a fully functional desktop application with a graphical user interface that encapsulates the existing CLI tool's power, adds database persistence for job history and configurations, and is packaged for easy distribution on major operating systems.

5.  **Core Controls: Implement Main Dashboard and Pipeline Controls**
    - Create main dashboard with start/stop controls (FR3)
    - Implement real-time progress indicator (FR4)
    - Add dual-mode logging (Standard/Debug) (FR4, FR10)
    - Include force stop all processes button (FR11)
    - Ensure responsive UI during backend processing (NFR1)
    - Style dashboard components with Tailwind CSS

6.  **Results: Implement 'Successful Results' View - (DONE)**
    - Create results gallery view
    - Display images with metadata and QC status (FR5)
    - Implement Excel export functionality (FR8)
    - Add image metadata display
    - Style gallery components with Tailwind CSS

7.  **Review: Implement 'Failed Images' Review Workflow**
    - Create failed images review interface
    - Display QC failure reasons (FR5)
    - Implement manual approval workflow
    - Add retry mechanisms for failed images
    - Style review components with Tailwind CSS

8.  **Persistence: Implement Job History and Advanced Features**
    - Complete job configuration saving (FR6)
    - Implement job results saving with full history (FR7)
    - Create job history view and management
    - Add data export and cleanup features
    - Style history components with Tailwind CSS

9.  **Distribution: Implement Application Packaging**
    - Configure Electron Builder for cross-platform packaging (NFR3)
    - Generate distributable installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux
    - Implement auto-update mechanism
    - Create deployment documentation
    - Optimize Vite build for production

10. **Testing: Implement Comprehensive Testing for Story 1.1**
    - Create unit tests for React components using React Testing Library
    - Implement integration tests for IPC communication
    - Create end-to-end tests for basic app functionality
    - Validate TypeScript type safety and configuration
    - Test cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Implement security tests for IPC and app security
    - Create performance and build optimization tests

11. **Security: Implement Production Security Measures**
    - Implement encrypted database fallback for API key storage
    - Add comprehensive memory protection for sensitive data
    - Create secure logging that masks API keys and sensitive information
    - Add security health checks and monitoring capabilities
    - Style security components with Tailwind CSS

12. **Results Enhancement: ZIP Export with Images and Metadata**
    - Add ZIP export button to ImageGallery for selected images
    - Package selected images with Excel metadata into downloadable ZIP files
    - Implement backend ZIP creation service with progress tracking
    - Create logical folder structure (images/ + metadata.xlsx)
    - Add file validation and error handling for missing images
    - Style ZIP export components with Tailwind CSS

13. **Testing Stabilization: Unit & Integration (Story 1.13)**
    - Stabilize database integration tests using in-memory/isolated SQLite and migrations in setup
    - Align settings integration tests with `BackendAdapter` (replace legacy `SettingsAdapter` usage)
    - Centralize Electron and `keytar` mocks; assert IPC handlers and payloads
    - Reflect Story 1.7 clamping rules in assertions
    - Provide npm scripts for targeted subsets (DB, settings, story-1.7)

**Testing Strategy**: Each story includes comprehensive testing tasks covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation as appropriate for the story scope. TypeScript will provide additional type safety during development. Story 1.10 specifically addresses the testing requirements for the foundational components from Story 1.1. Story 1.13 stabilizes unit and integration tests to ensure CI reliability and alignment with current architecture.
