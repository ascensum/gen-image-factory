## Release Notes Automation

**Note**: Release notes are automatically generated by GitHub using Conventional Commits and the `.github/release.yml` configuration. The release notes appear in GitHub Releases and are automatically displayed to users via `electron-updater`.

### Commit Message Format

To ensure proper categorization in release notes, use Conventional Commits format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `security:` - Security fixes

**Examples**:
- `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle`
- `fix(tray): fix icon not disappearing on exit`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `docs: update README with installation instructions`

### Dependabot Integration

Dependabot PRs are automatically labeled with `dependencies` and `automated`, and will appear under "🛡️ Security & Dependencies" in release notes.
